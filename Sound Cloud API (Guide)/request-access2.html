  <h1>Making The Request Continue</h1>
  <p>We saw how easily you can implement this on a normal browser and get bunch of Data back.<br/>
  Lets talk about how this can be done in JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Requesting information from the API follows the same principlas for JavaScript. Example below shows<br/>
  exaclty how you can get some data back from the API.</p>
  <h3>1. Create your own variables</h3>
  <p>Creating your own varibles is a very important thing to rememeber. In this case it would be very easy to just change the information on the base URL.However, in the future if you have multiple links, it would be very useful to just have a value in a variable and use that variable to make the call. Because if you have to change something then you wouldnt have to go through every single link. You could just muniplate the variable. See example Below.<p>
  <script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/teymourk/s0z8tyzd/embed/js/dark/"></script>
  <h3>Explanation on The variables</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><mark>type</mark> you could either request a <span class=redText>"GET"</span> or <span class=redText>"POST"</span>. In this case we are sending a "GET" Request.</li>
    <li><mark>baseURL</mark> is essensially the API URL that contains all the datas for sound cloud.</li>
    <li><mark>query</mark> is the Track Id that we are asking for. We are going to discuss how you could get different track ids later.</li>
    <li><mark>apiKey</mark> is where you put your Application ID to get permission from the API to access the Data.</li>
    <li><mark>request</mark> just sends an <span class=redText>HTTP Request</span> to the API.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>2. Put All the links to gether</h3>
  <p>This is where creating variables becomes handy. You are easily able to maintaine a clean code and be able to make any modifications eaily.</p>
  <script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/teymourk/axo9f5he/embed/js/dark/"></script>
  <h3>3.Call and Load Data</h3>
  <p> This is Essentially the last step to make your API Call. Response is a variable that is taking the value of request in a Text Format or JSON. But before all that happens it always good to have an error check to make sure that the request went through with no problems occuring.<br/> <span class=redText>var response = JSON.parse(request.responseText); </span> and <span class=redText>console.log</span> will just print everything that was recieved by response in the console.</p>
  <script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/teymourk/yahdynb3/1/embed/js/dark/"></script>
  <h3>4.Finished Product</h3>
  <p>Once you have everything put together, this is how your final result should look like. Using this, you could almost make any request to other APIs.</p>
