  <h1>Embed SoundCloud Track Widget</h1>
  <p> So far we have learned how to get track ids and use that to get the track information using the API base URL. Now lets move to the cooler stuff. In this section Im going to show you guys how to embed the track widget using the track ID we got from the last tutorial. 
  <p>Using JSFiddle, im going to show you steps on how you could apply this to your own application.This could become very useful in the future when you are trying to play music or tracks on your own application.</p>
  <script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/teymourk/a72eu57m/1/embed/html/dark/"></script>
  <p>Now just like how we applied the SDK in the last tutorial, we are going to have to do the same thing by applying this line of code. <span class=redText>src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/181164088."</span> dont worry too much about the frame. Its only used to create the frame for the widget.The next line of code <span class=redText> src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/api.js"</span> imports the library for the widget functionality like pausing and playing. 
  <h3>Recieve Data Functiom</h3>
  <p>Now that we have that setup, its time to call the function and recieve the data we requested for the widget.See Example below.</p>

  <p>As You can see this function allows us to do many things but first we need to make sure to import our widget by calling <span class=redText>var widgetIframe = document.getElementById('sc-widget')</span> Using this we could access the sound and many other features that come along with it.</p>
  <script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/teymourk/59zcn279/embed/js/dark/"></script></p>
  <h3>Final Products</h3>
  <p>Now if we put all these codes together we should have something that looks like the example down below. Now keep in mind that this is the exact same track we got the data from in the previous tutorials. Click on the result option to see magic happen :)!</p>
